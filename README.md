# MACS-207
### Data Visualization Project
This project depicts a network graph based on the connections between directors and actors based on the movies that they directed / acted in of 100-crore grossing films. It illustrates a visualization of popular films in the various languages that have topped the charts as well as shows us how many of the actors are repeatedly in these 100 crore films. The green nodes of this graph represents each director from the list of films and each red node represents an actor. Each edge means that a director has casted this actor in one of these films.\
