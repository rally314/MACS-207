This visualization depicts a network graph of the connections between directors and actors in 100-crore grossing films, and is based on these films that they directed / acted in. The visualization shows popular films in the various languages that have topped the charts, as well as shows how many of the actors are repeatedly casted by the same directors in these 100 crore films. The green nodes of this graph represents each director from the list of films and each red node represents each actor in the list of films. Each edge means that a director has casted this actor in one of these films.
